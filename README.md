Typed.js is a library that types. Enter in any string, and watch it type   at the speed you've set, backspace what it's typed, and begin a   new sentence for however many strings you've set.  

For React.js--  
    # choose any one..  
        npm install typed.js  
        yarn add typed.js  
        bower install typed.js  

    # Setup

        import Typed from 'typed.js';  
        var options = {  
          strings: ['<i>First</i> sentence.', '&amp; a second sentence.'],  
          typeSpeed: 40  
        };  
        var typed = new Typed('.element', options);
